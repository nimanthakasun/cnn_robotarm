# SelecSLS based Motion Capture System for Human Machine Interaction
## Background
## Building
### Prerequisites
1. PyCharm IDE
2. Python Installation with
3. Conda Installation or
4. Just Conda would be fine
5. Dataset (I used HumanEva I dataset)
5Python Packages (I used most recent stable versions at the time)
   1. OpenCV
   2. Numpy
   3. Tensorflow-CPU (If you are using GPU version you might need to change the code)
   4. PyTorch
   5. Flax
   6. [Pyomeca](https://github.com/pyomeca) from Conda forge
### Build Instructions
1. Open the project folder in PyCharm IDE
2. Create virtual environment using PyCharm "Add Interpreter" option
3. Add necessary packages to the virtual environment. (If the packages have been already installed with the main Python installation, you can inherit them as well)
